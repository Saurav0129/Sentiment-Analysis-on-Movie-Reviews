# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews

## Project Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, providing insights into consumer opinions and demonstrating the application of various machine learning techniques for natural language processing.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing including HTML tag removal, URL cleaning, punctuation removal, and text normalization
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Implementation of three machine learning models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- Performance comparison of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- BeautifulSoup

## Results
The project achieves the following accuracy scores:
- SVM: 88.69%
- Naive Bayes: 85.00%
- Logistic Regression: 88.39%

Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrices are provided for each model.

## Future Work
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- Expand to multi-class sentiment analysis
- Develop a web application for real-time sentiment analysis
